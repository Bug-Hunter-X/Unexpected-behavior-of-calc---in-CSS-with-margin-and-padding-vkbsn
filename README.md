# Unexpected behavior of calc() in CSS with margin and padding

This repository demonstrates an issue where the CSS `calc()` function exhibits unexpected behavior when used with properties like `margin` or `padding`. The problem lies in the interaction between the `calc()` function and unit handling, leading to incorrect calculations and layout problems.

The `bug.css` file shows the code with the problematic `calc()` usage. The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution to resolve this issue by ensuring unit consistency and correct calculation order.
